# SingleNeuron
A one-neuron machine learning program made from scratch. It is trained to detect patterns in a series of 1's and 0's.

I wrote an article on how to make this, you can find it [here!](https://medium.com/@michaeldelsole/a-single-layer-artificial-neural-network-in-20-lines-of-python-ae34b47e5fef) 

## Examples:

## Technique
Using forward and backpropagation, the program successfully determines that there should be a 1 outputted by the new example, 
as the rule it should figure out is that there should be a 1 outputted if and only if there is a 1 in the rightmost column.
